h4. Domains List

_*Necessary*_

You have to explicitely set the domains that your application is going to manage.

The property is a list of strings containing the full class name of your domains

By default it contains an empty list.

{code}
grails.plugin.admin.domains = [
    "net.kaleidos.TestDomain",
    "net.kaleidos.AnotherDomain"
]
{code}

h4. Admin accessRoot

_Optional_

A good security practice is not to use a "standard" URI to access your administration backend.

Grails-Admin allows you to customize the endpoint so it uses a custom one.

By default the value is /admin

{code}
grails.plugin.admin.accessRoot = "/admin"
{code}

h4. Security access role

_Optional_

The default role required for a user to access the admin is "ROLE_ADMIN" but you can customize
to use any role defined with your application.

{code}
grails.plugin.admin.role = "ROLE_ADMIN"
{code}
